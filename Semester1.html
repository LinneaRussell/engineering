      <u>Week 2!</u> Hi, this is friday August 26th and today we did a challenge
      with a marble. We had nine pipes and had to connect them together in order
      to get the marble into the bucket. It was surprisingly difficult because
      we had to constantly move around and pass along the pipes, but we
      eventually got it and did well.

      <u>Week 3!</u>This week I learned a lot of stuff. On Wednesday we started
      using Tinkercad and It is very difficult to use, but I think I'm staring
      to get the hang of it. Today(friday) we did a challenge. We had to bring
      an object from home and then make it in tinkercad. This took a while to do
      but I am pretty happy with my results.

      <u>Week 4!</u>Today on Semptember 14th, we worked on our Rube Goldberg
      machine. My group and I finished our ramp with the incline. We also got to
      finish the pulley on top of the incline. So far we have not run into any
      problems and I am happy with how it looks. Today September 16th we did a
      challenge with a paper boat. My groups boat failed miserably. We should
      have explanded the surface area of the boat. Instead we put it in the
      water and it sank immediatly.

      <u>Week 5!</u> This week we mostly worked on our Rube Goldberg project. On
      monday we got a lot of work done on our machine. Our whole incline ramp a
      well as the pulley was completed that day. Then, on wednesday we got to
      work some more on it. After our final adjustments, we got to testing. Our
      balloon thankfully popped after the first try. Our car that was pushed by
      the baseball rolled very slowly but either way it worked out.
      Today(friday) more groups are testing their machines and we get to watch
      all the creative projects made.

      <u>Week 6!</u>This week we got to take apart old computers. This was a
      very cool projectand helped me understand how a computer is built. Some of
      the screws were very difficult to get out but other than that my group and
      I did well. After following the slides and taking it apart, we got to put
      the whole thing back together. We struggled a little bit when it came to
      remembering which screw went where, but eventually we got it down.
      Overall, this was a good week in this class.

      <u>Week 7!</u>On week 7 we started a new chapter on Bioengineering.
      Bioengineering is very interesting. It includes making prosthetics, making
      machinery for hospitals, and has a lot of links to the medical field. 10/5
      our class did a challenge that included finding and researching an animal
      of our choice. I chose a shark. Then we had to pick a limb of the animal
      and make a realistic prosthetic for it. I picked the dorsal fun and made
      it of carbon fiber and Slicone. Today on 10/7 we did a challenge to write
      the exact instructions of making a PB&J. It was much more difficult than I
      had expected to write such clear instructions.

      <u>Week 8!</u>This week we started a new field of engineering, aerospace.
      We are doing a project related to this field, which will be making a
      bottle rocket. This rocket will be made up a 1-2 liter soda can with
      wings, a cone, and a lot of duct tape. Tomorrow our groups will start
      building. Today 13/10, we did a challenge with paper airplanes. I made an
      airplane but when I threw it off the building, it almost went backwards.
      So, I would call that challenge a fail on my part.

      <u>Week 9!</u>This week my group and I worked on our bottle rockets. OUr
      design ressembled a biplane. On Friday we got to test it. Our plane did
      many circles in the air and then crashed. I think that if the wings of our
      rocket were angled well, it could have gone further. It was very fun
      watching the other groups rockets and how they did.

      <u>Week 10!</u>This week we worked on environmenal engineering. This
      includes making the Earth healtheir and trying to prevent pollution of all
      sorts. We did a water filering project on Friday. My group put a lot of
      tissue on the bottom, then sand, small rocks, and on the top had the big
      rocks. When we poured in contaminated water, the rocks and bigger debris
      was caught in the layers, as well as small grains and such. Our water
      turned out very clear! Another halloween challenge we did was guessing how
      many candy corns could fit on a paper. My group and I were way to low.

      <u>Week 11!</u>In week 11 we started a new unit for electrical
      engineering. The first day we watched as slide show presentation where we
      learned some basics on engineering. We also did some math with equations
      finding resistance, amps, and things. The next class we started using
      tinkercad. We had to copy diagrams of circuits put up on the board to try
      and use resistors and light up lights. It took me some getting used to and
      was pretty difficult getting the lights to light up. Although, I just had
      to figure out how to correctly connect it and then got it figured out.

      <u>Week 12!</u>This week we worked on electrical engineering. Me and my
      partner worked together to work on the circuit board. The goal was to get
      the LED lights to ligh tup in different circuits. We had accidentally used
      the wrong lights for the series board which was our only mistake. On
      Thursday we did a challenge with math. It was asking which would take
      longer, sitting in a math class for 50 minutes every school day, or
      counting to a million. I got that the math class would total to 150 hours
      and too count to 1 million wold take me 833 hours. I averaged that every
      number would take about 3 seconds for me to say(since the larger numbers
      take longer to say) and then I muntiplied 1 million by 3 for 3 seconds.
      After that, I ended up with seconds which I then converted to hours. In
      the end, I would much rather sit in math since I enjoy math and we already
      do that for school everyday.

      <u>Week 13!</u>This week we started our sphagetti bridges. We need to make
      4 prototypes. Our first prototype was used 20 pieces to make a straight
      across bridge. We attempted to make it a triangle bridge to create
      support. It was very difficult making all the little cut pieces even and
      getting them to glue onto the other pieces. Another issue we had was
      getting our bridge off of the paper towels they dried on.
