<h3>I am a junior at Crescenta Valley high school. I enjoy lots of things such as playing tennis, listening to music, and decorating.<hr></h3>
    <h3>Today we all played a name game<br> and I had to recite 36 names and facts.</h3>

    <p><u>Week 2!</u> Hi, this is friday August 26th and today we did a challenge with a marble. We had nine pipes and had to connect them together in order to get the marble into the bucket.
    It was surprisingly difficult because we had to constantly move around and pass along the pipes, but we eventually got it and did well.</p>

    <p><u>Week 3!</u>This week I learned a lot of stuff. On Wednesday we started using Tinkercad and It is very difficult to use, but I think I'm staring to get the hang of it. Today(friday) we did a challenge. We had to bring an object from home and then make it in tinkercad. This took a while to do but I am pretty happy with my results.</p>

    <p><u>Week 4!</u>Today on Semptember 14th, we worked on our Rube Goldberg machine. My group and I finished our ramp with the incline. We also got to finish the pulley on top of the incline. So far
    we have not run into any problems and I am happy with how it looks. Today September 16th we did a challenge with  a paper boat. My groups boat failed miserably. We should have explanded the 
    surface area of the boat. Instead we put it in the water and it sank immediatly. </p>

    <p><u>Week 5!</u> This week we mostly worked on our Rube Goldberg project. On monday we got a lot of work done on our machine. Our whole incline ramp a well as the pulley was completed that day.
    Then, on wednesday we got to work some more on it. After our final adjustments, we got to testing. Our balloon thankfully popped after the first try. Our car that was pushed by the baseball rolled 
    very slowly but either way it worked out. Today(friday) more groups are testing their machines and we get to watch all the creative projects made.</p>

    <p><u>Week 6!</u>This week we got to take apart old computers. This was a very cool projectand helped 
    me understand how a computer is built. Some of the screws were very difficult to 
    get out but other than that my group and I did well. After following the slides and taking it apart,
    we got to put the whole thing back together. We struggled a little bit when it came to remembering
    which screw went where, but eventually we got it down. Overall, this was a good week in this class.</p>

    <p><u>Week 7!</u>On week 7 we started a new chapter on Bioengineering. Bioengineering is very interesting. It includes making prosthetics, making machinery for hospitals, and has a lot of links to the medical field.
    10/5 our class did a challenge that 
    included finding and researching an animal of our choice. I chose a shark. Then we had to pick
    a limb of the animal and make a realistic prosthetic for it. I picked the dorsal fun and made it of
    carbon fiber and Slicone. Today on 10/7 we did a challenge to write the exact instructions 
    of making a PB&J. It was much more difficult than I had expected to write such clear instructions.</p>

    <p><u>Week 8!</u>This week we started a new field of engineering, aerospace. We are doing
    a project related to this field, which will be making a bottle rocket. This rocket will
    be made up a 1-2 liter soda can with wings, a cone, and a lot of duct tape. Tomorrow our groups
    will start building. Today 13/10, we did a challenge with paper airplanes. I made an airplane but
    when I threw it off the building, it almost went backwards. So, I would call that challenge a fail on my part.</p>

    <p><u>Week 9!</u>This week my group and I worked on our bottle rockets. OUr design ressembled a biplane. 
    On Friday we got to test it. Our plane did many circles in the air and then crashed.
    I think that if the wings of our rocket were angled well, it could have gone further. It was very
    fun watching the other groups rockets and how they did. </p>

    <p><u>Week 10!</u>This week we worked on environmenal engineering. This includes making the Earth healtheir
    and trying to prevent pollution of all sorts. We did a water filering project on Friday. My group put 
    a lot of tissue on the bottom, then sand, small rocks, and on the top had the big rocks. When we 
    poured in contaminated water, the rocks and bigger debris was caught in the layers, as well as small grains and such.
    Our water turned out very clear! Another halloween challenge we did was guessing how many
    candy corns could fit on a paper. My group and I were way to low.

    <p><u>Week 11!</u>In week 11 we started a new unit for electrical engineering. The first day we watched 
    as slide show presentation where we learned some basics on engineering. We also did some math with equations finding 
    resistance, amps, and things. The next class we started using tinkercad. We had to copy diagrams of circuits put up on the board
    to try and use resistors and light up lights. It took me some getting used to and was pretty difficult getting the lights to light up. Although,
    I just had to figure out how to correctly connect it and then got it figured out.</p>

    <p><u>Week 12!</u>This week we worked on electrical engineering. Me and my partner 
    worked together to work on the circuit board. The goal was to get the LED lights to ligh tup in different 
    circuits. We had accidentally used the wrong lights for the series board which was our only mistake.
    On Thursday we did a challenge with math. It was asking which would take longer, sitting in a math class
    for 50 minutes every school day, or counting to a million. I got that the math class would total to 
    150 hours and too count to 1 million wold take me 833 hours. I averaged that every number would take about 3 seconds for me to say(since the larger numbers take longer to say) and then I muntiplied 1 million by 3 for 3 seconds. After that, I ended up with seconds which I then converted to hours. In the end, I would much rather sit in math since I enjoy math and we already do that for school everyday.

    <p><u>Week 13!</u>This week we started our sphagetti bridges. We need to make 4 prototypes. Our first prototype 
    was used 20 pieces to make a straight across bridge. We attempted to make it a triangle bridge to create support. 
    It was very difficult making all the little cut pieces even and getting them to glue onto the other pieces.
    Another issue we had was getting our bridge off of the paper towels they dried on.

    <h1><b><u>SEMESTER 2</u></b></h1>
    
    <p><u>Week 1!</u>This week we learned about business engineering. These engineers work 
    with many groups of people within their jobs and sometimes have to design and advertise new products for
    a certain group of people. Our groups had to come up with a helpful invention and present to the class.
    My groups invention was a new Math website called The Mathinator. It was mostly to help students or anyone
    who uses math on the daily, and wants a reliable, fast, and easy website to use for complicated problems a normal calculator would not be able to solve.
    This was a very difficult project since my group had so many designs to choose from in so little time.</p>
